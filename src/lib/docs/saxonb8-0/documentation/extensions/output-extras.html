      <h1>Additional attributes for xsl:output</h1>
      
      
      <p>A number of additional attributes, or attribute values, are allowed on the xsl:output
         element, beyond those defined in the XSLT 2.0 specification.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <p class="subhead">The method attribute</p>
      
      
      <p>The <code>method</code> attribute of <code>xsl:output</code> 
         can take the standard values "xml",
         "html", "xhtml", or "text", or a <i>QName</i>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If a QName is specified, the local name may be:</p>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         
         
         <li>
            <p>the fully-qualified
               class name of a class that implements either the 
               SAX2 <code>org.xml.sax.ContentHandler</code> interface, or the
               <code>net.sf.saxon.event.Receiver</code> interface. If such a value is specified,
               output is directed to a newly-created instance of the user-supplied class.
               You can pass additional information to this class by means of extra user-defined attributes
               on the <code>xsl:output</code> element.
            </p>
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      
      <p> The prefix of the <i>QName</i> must correspond to a valid
         namespace URI. It is recommended to use the Saxon URI "http://saxon.sf.net/",
         but this is not enforced.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <p class="subhead">The saxon:indent-spaces attribute</p>
      
      
      <p>When the output is XML or HTML with indent="yes", the saxon:indent-spaces attribute may
         be used to control the amount of indentation. The value must be an integer.
      </p>
      
      
      <p class="subhead">The saxon:character-representation attribute</p>
      
      
      <p>This attribute allows greater control
         over how non-ASCII characters will be represented on output.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>With method="xml", two values are supported: "decimal" and "hex". These control whether
         numeric character references are output in decimal or hexadecimal when the character
         is not available in the selected encoding. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p>With HTML, the value
         may hold two strings, separated by a semicolon. The first string defines how non-ASCII
         characters within the character encoding will be represented, the values being "native",
         "entity", "decimal", or "hex". The second string defines how characters outside the
         encoding will be represented, the values being "entity", "decimal", or "hex". Here "native"
         means output the character as itself; "entity" means use a defined entity reference (such
         as "&amp;eacute;") if known; "decimal" and "hex" refer to numeric character references.
         For example "entity;decimal" (the default) means that with encoding="iso-8859-1",
         characters in the range 160-255 will be represented using standard HTML entity
         references, while Unicode characters above 255 will be represented as decimal character
         references.
      </p>
      
      
      <p class="subhead">The saxon:byte-order-mark attribute</p>
      
      
      <p>This attribute may take the values "yes" or "no": the default is "no". If set to "yes",
         a byte order mark (Unicode xFEFF) is output at the start of the output file. This option is
         available with all output methods and all encodings, though it is most useful when producing
         XML encoded in UTF-8. Under the rules of XML 1.0 Second Edition, XML parsers are required
         to accept a byte order mark at the start of the file; however, some parsers written before
         the Second Edition was published may reject it. <i>In particular, the Crimson parser included
            as the default XML parser in JDK 1.4 rejects byte order marks.</i></p>
      
      
      <p class="subhead">The saxon:next-in-chain attribute</p>
      
      
      <p>The <code>saxon:next-in-chain</code> attribute is used to direct the output to another stylesheet. The
         value is the URL of a stylesheet that should be used to process the output stream. In this case
         the output stream must always be pure XML, and attributes that control the format of the output
         (e.g. method, cdata-section-elements, etc) will have no effect. The output of the second stylesheet
         will be directed to the destination that would have been used for the first stylesheet if
         no <code>saxon:next-in-chain</code> attribute were not present.
      </p>
      
      
      <p class="subhead">The saxon:require-well-formed attribute</p>
      
      
      <p>The attribute <code>saxon:require-well-formed</code> is available, with
         values "yes" or "no". The default is "no". If the value is set to "yes", and a user-written
         <code>ContentHandler</code> is supplied to receive the results of the transformation, then Saxon will report an
         error rather than sending a non-well-formed stream of SAX events to the <code>ContentHandler</code>.
         This attribute is useful when the output of the stylesheet is sent to a component (for example an XSL-FO
         rendering engine) that is not designed to accept non-well-formed XML result trees.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Note also that namespace undeclarations of the form <code>xmlns:p=""</code> (as permitted
         by XML Namespaces 1.1) are passed to the <code>startPrefixMapping()</code> method of  
         a user-defined <code>ContentHandler</code> only if
         <code>undeclare-namespaces="yes"</code> is specified on <code>xsl:output</code>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p class="subhead">User defined attributes</p>
      
      
      <p>Any number of
         user-defined attributes may be defined on <code>xsl:output</code>. These 
         attributes must have names in a non-null namespace, which must not be either the XSLT
         or the Saxon namespace. These attributes are interpreted as attribute value templates.
         The value of the attribute is inserted into the Properties object made available to 
         the Emitter handling the output; they will be ignored by the standard output methods,
         but can supply arbitrary information to a user-defined output method. The name of the
         property will be the expanded name of the attribute in JAXP format, for example
         "{http://my-namespace/uri}local-name", and the value will be the value as given,
         after evaluation as an attribute value template.
