      <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
      
      
      <p>The following software must be installed separately, it is not included with the Saxon download.</p>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>
            <p>To run Saxon you need at least a Java VM, and preferably a Java development environment. 
               Saxon 8.0 requires JDK 1.4; this means it will no longer work with the Microsoft Java VM.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         
         <li>
            <p>Saxon has an option to work with a source tree constructed using
               <a href="http://www.jdom.org/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">JDOM</a>. Saxon 8.0 is validated with
               JDOM beta 10; it probably works with JDOM beta 9, but may not work with earlier releases.
            </p>
         </li> 
         
      </ul>
      
      
      <p>Saxon has been tested successfully in the past with a wide variety of XML parsers including
         Xerces, Lark, SUN Project X, Crimson, Piccolo, Oracle XML, xerces, xml4j, and xp. Use of a SAX2-compliant
         parser is now mandatory. All the relevant classes must be installed on your Java CLASSPATH.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Earlier releases of Saxon included a version of the &AElig;lfred XML parser. This is no longer bundled with the
         Saxon distribution, because JDK 1.4 now includes an XML parser as standard, but the &AElig;lfred XML parser remains
         available as a separate download from
         <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=29872&amp;package_id=66578" target="_blank" class="bodylink">the Saxon site at SourceForge.</a></p>
      
      
      <p>Saxon's DOM interface has been tested with the Crimson parser included as standard in
         Sun's JDK 1.4 platform and with the Xerces 2.5.0 DOM implementation.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Because Saxon is run from the command line, you might find it useful (under Microsoft Windows)
         to have a text editor
         with better command-line support than the standard DOS window. I use <a href="http://www.jedit.org" target="_blank" class="bodylink">jEdit</a>, 
         which is an open source product with a wide-selection of optional plug-ins, including one for editing XQuery.
