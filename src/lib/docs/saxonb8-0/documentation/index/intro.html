      <p>Release 8.0 is the latest installment of Saxonica's progressive implementation of the 
         <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20" target="_blank" class="bodylink">XPath 2.0</a>, 
         <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20" target="_blank" class="bodylink">XSLT 2.0</a>, and
         <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery" target="_blank" class="bodylink">XQuery 1.0</a> specifications. For this first time,
         this release implements the schema-aware features of these languages, and also includes
         a free-standing schema processor conforming to 
         <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/PER-xmlschema-1-20040318/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">XML Schema 1.0</a></p>
      
      
      <p><b>Saxon 8.0 is the first version of Saxon to be schema-aware.</b></p>
      
      
      <p>The product is aligned with the working drafts published on 12 November 2003,
         though a few features are not yet implemented, and some changes have been made to implement
         decisions made by the working groups since those drafts were published.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Saxon 8.0 is now available in two versions. Saxon-B 8.0 is a non-schema-aware
         processor, and is available as an open-source product, free of charge, from 
         <a href="http://saxon.sf.net/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">SourceForge</a>. It is designed to conform to the
         basic conformance level of XSLT 2.0, and the equivalent level of functionality in XQuery 1.0. 
         Saxon-SA 8.0 is the schema-aware version of the package, and is available as a commercially
         supported product from <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">Saxonica Limited</a>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>This documentation covers both products, with differences noted where applicable.</p>
      
      
      <div class="boxed" style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px">Please note: this documentation is provided on the 
         <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">Saxonica</a> web site and also in the download file.
         On occasions the online version may be more up-to-date. The download file also includes full
         API documentation,: see the doc/api directory.

      <p><a href="../../javadoc/index.html" target="_blank" class="bodylink">JavaDoc API specifications</a> (for the current release only)
         are also available.
      </p> 
      
      
      <p>Changes since release 7.9.1 are listed in <a class="bodylink" href="javascript:topage('changes', 'intro')">changes.html</a></p> 
      
      
      <p>Saxon 7.x has been used for production applications by many users. The code is proving
         stable and reliable. However, you need to be aware that the specifications are still
         subject to change, and that new Saxon releases will track the changing specifications
         with no concessions to backward compatibility.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If you are looking for complete stability, 
         the preferred version for production use remains
         <a href="http://saxon.sf.net/saxon6.5.3/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">Saxon 6.5.3</a>, which
         implements XSLT 1.0 and XPath 1.0.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Saxon 8.0 requires Java JDK 1.4</p>
