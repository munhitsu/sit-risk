      <h1>Invoking XQuery from Java</h1>
      
      
      
      <p>Rather than using the query processor from the command line, you may want to issue queries from your
         own application, perhaps one that enables it to be used within an applet or servlet. If you run
         the processor repeatedly, this will always be much faster than running it each time from
         a command line, even if it handles a different query each time.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>There is currently no standard API for XQuery, so Saxon provides its own. It is fully described
         in the JavaDoc included in the download: look for the package <code>net.sf.saxon.query</code>.
         The starting point is the class <code>QueryProcessor</code>. What follows here is an
         overview. For an example of how the API can be used, take a look at the source code for the class
         <code>net.sf.saxon.Query</code>, which implements the command line interface.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The first thing you need to do is to create a <code>net.sf.saxon.Configuration</code> object.
         This holds values of all the system settings, corresponding to flags available on the command line.
         You don't need to set any properties in the <code>Configuration</code> object if you are happy
         with the default settings.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><i>For schema-aware processing, assuming you are using the schema-aware version of Saxon, 
            create an instance of
            <code>com.saxonica.validate.SchemaAwareConfiguration</code>, which is a subclass of
            <code>Configuration</code>.</i></p>
      
      
      <p>Then you need to create a <code>net.sf.saxon.StaticQueryContext</code> object. As the name
         implies, this holds information about the static (compile-time) context for a query. Most aspects
         of the static context can be defined in the Query Prolog, but this object allows you to initialize
         the static context from the application instead if you need to. Some of the facilities provided are
         very much for advanced users only, for example the ability to declare variables and functions, and
         the ability to specify a NamePool to be used. One aspect of the static context that you may need
         to use is the ability to declare collations. Using the method <code>declareCollation</code> you can
         create a mapping between a collation URI (which can then be used anywhere in the Query) and a Java
         <code>Comparator</code> object used to implement that collation.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Having created, and possibly configured, the <code>Configuration</code> and
         <code>StaticQueryContext</code> objects, you can now create a <code>QueryProcessor</code> object
         with a call such as:
      </p> 
      
      
      <div class="codeblock" style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px"><pre><code>
     Configuration config = new Configuration();
     StaticQueryContext staticContext = new StaticQueryContext(config);
     QueryProcessor xquery = new QueryProcessor(staticContext);
</code></pre></div>
      
      
      <p>The <code>QueryProcessor</code> object can now be used to compile a Query. The text of the
         Query can be supplied either as a <code>String</code> or as a Java <code>Reader</code>. There
         are thus two different <code>compileQuery</code> methods. Each of them returns the compiled
         query in the form of an <code>XQueryExpression</code>. The <code>XQueryExpression</code>, as you would expect,
         can be executed repeatedly, as often as you want, in the same or in different threads.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>For example:</p>
      
      
      <div class="codeblock" style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px"><pre><code>
     XQueryExpression exp = xquery.compileQuery("count(//book)");
</code></pre></div>
      
      
      <p>Before you run your query, you may want to build one or more trees representing
         XML documents that can be used as input to your query. You don't need to do this: if the query
         loads its source documents using the <code>doc()</code> function then this will be done
         automatically, but doing it yourself gives you more control. A document node at the root of
         a tree is represented in Saxon by the <code>net.sf.saxon.DocumentInfo</code> interface.
         The <code>QueryProcessor</code> provides a convenience method, <code>buildDocument()</code>,
         that allows an instance of <code>DocumentInfo</code> to be constructed. The input parameter to
         this is defined by the class <code>javax.xml.transform.Source</code>, which is part of the 
         standard Java JAXP API: the <code>Source</code> interface is an umbrella for different kinds of
         XML document source, including a <code>StreamSource</code> which parses raw XML from a byte
         or character stream, <code>SAXSource</code> which takes the input from a SAX parser (or an
         object that is simulating a SAX parser), and <code>DOMSource</code> which provides the input
         from a DOM.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Saxon also provides a several additional implementations of the <code>Source</code> interface
         that can be used as input to this method. Saxon's <code>DocumentInfo</code> and <code>NodeInfo</code>
         classes both implement this interface, though this isn't useful for this particular method because
         you will only have one of these once you have built the tree from some other source.
         The <code>net.sf.saxon.jdom.DocumentWrapper</code> class allows
         the input to be taken from a JDOM document. The <code>net.sf.saxon.AugmentedSource</code> object
         can wrap any other kind of <code>Source</code>, and provides additional options as to how the <code>Source</code>
         should be processed, for example whether it should be validated against a schema. This will only work if
         you created the <code>QueryProcessor</code> using a <code>SchemaAwareConfiguration</code>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>To execute your compiled query, you need to create a <code>DynamicQueryContext</code> object
         that holds the run-time context information. The main things you can set in the run-time context are:
      </p>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>
            <p>Values of parameters (external global variables). You can set these using the <code>setParameter()</code>
               method. The mappings from Java classes to XQuery/XPath data types is the same as the mapping used for the
               returned values from an external Java method call, and is described under 
               <a class="bodylink" href="javascript:topage('extensibility', 'function-result')">Result of an Extension Function</a>.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>The context node can be set using the method <code>setContextNode()</code> or
               <code>setContextItem()</code>.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>You can also set a URIResolver and/or ErrorListener. These default to the ones that were
               used during Query compilation.
            </p>
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      
      <p>You are now ready to evaluate the query. There are several methods on the <code>QueryExpression</code>
         object that you can use to achieve this. The <code>evaluate()</code> method returns the result sequence 
         as a Java <code>java.util.List</code>. The <code>evaluateSingle()</code> method is suitable when you know
         that the result sequence will contain a single item: this returns this item as an Object, or returns null
         if the result is an empty sequence. There is also an <code>iterator</code> method that returns an iterator
         over the results. This is a Saxon object of class <code>net.sf.saxon.om.SequenceIterator</code>: it is similar
         to the standard Java iterator, but not quite identical; for example, it can throw exceptions. Finally,
         there is a <code>run()</code> method, which executes the query, converts the results to an XML document,
         and writes this document to a JAXP <code>Result</code> object, which may represent a DOM, a SAX ContentHandler,
         or a serial output stream.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The <code>evaluate()</code> and <code>evaluateSingle()</code> methods return the result as a Java object
         of the most appropriate type: for example a String is returned as a <code>java.lang.String</code>, a 
         boolean as a <code>java.lang.Boolean</code>. A node is returned using the Saxon representation of a node,
         <code>net.sf.saxon.om.NodeInfo</code>. With the standard and tinytree models, this object also implements
         the DOM <code>Node</code> interface (but any attempt to update the node throws an error).
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The <code>iterator()</code> method, by contrast, does not do any conversion of the result. It is returned
         using its native Saxon representation, for example a String is returned as an instance of 
         <code>sf.net.saxon.value.StringValue</code>. You can then use all the methods available on this class
         to process the returned value.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The <code>run()</code> method is probably the most efficient in the case of queries that construct a new
         document as their output, because it allows the nodes of the result document to be serialized (or sent to the
         destination) as they are created, without creating a tree structure in memory first.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Here is a simple example for a query that returns a singleton integer result:</p>
      
      
      <div class="codeblock" style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px"><pre><code>
     DynamicQueryContext dynamicContext = new DynamicQueryContext();
     dynamicContext.setContextNode(xquery.buildDocument(new StreamSource(new File("books.xml")));
     Integer count = (Integer)exp.evaluateSingle(dynamicContext);
     System.out.println("There are " + count.intValue() + " books");
</code></pre></div>
      
      
      <p>Here is an example where the query returns a list of nodes:</p>
      
      
      <div class="codeblock" style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px"><pre><code>
     XQueryExpression exp = xquery.compileQuery("//book/title");
     DynamicQueryContext dynamicContext = new DynamicQueryContext();
     dynamicContext.setContextNode(xquery.buildDocument(new StreamSource(new File("books.xml")));
     SequenceIterator books = exp.iterator(dynamicContext);
     while (true) {
         NodeInfo book = books.next();
         if (book==null) break;
         String title = book.getStringValue();
         System.out.println(title);
     }
</code></pre></div>
      
      
      <p>If you want to process the results of the query in your application, that's all there is to it. But you
         may want to output the results as serialized XML. Saxon provides two ways of doing this: you can produce
         wrapped output, or raw output. Raw output works only if the result consists of a single document or element
         node, and it outputs the subtree rooted at that element node in the form of a serialized XML document. The
         simplest way to produce raw output is to use the <code>run()</code> method on the <code>XQueryExpression</code>
         object, but you can also do it by retrieving the result as a SequenceIterator and passing this to the
         <code>serialize()</code> method of the <code>QueryResult</code> class.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Wrapped
         output works for any result sequence, for example a sequence of integers or a sequence of attribute and
         comment nodes; this works by wrapping each item in the result sequence as an XML element, with details
         of its type and value. To produce wrapped output, you first wrap the result sequence as an XML tree, and then serialize the
         tree. This can be done using the <code>QueryResult</code> class. This class doesn't need to be
         instantiated, its methods are static. The method <code>QueryResult.wrap</code> takes as input the iterator
         produced by evaluating the query using the <code>iterator()</code> method, and produces as output
         a <code>DocumentInfo</code> object representing the results wrapped as an XML tree. The method
         <code>QueryResult.serialize</code> takes any document or element node as input, and writes it to
         a specified destination, using specified output properties. The destination is supplied as an object
         of class <code>javax.xml.transform.Result</code>. Like the <code>Source</code>, this is part of the
         JAXP API, and allows the destination to be specified as a StreamResult (representing a byte stream or
         character stream), a SAXResult (which wraps a SAX ContentHandler), or a DOMResult
         (which delivers the result as a DOM). The output properties are used only when writing to
         a StreamResult: they correspond to the properties available in the <code>xsl:output</code> element
         for XSLT. The property names are defined by constants in the JAXP <code>javax.xml.transform.OutputKeys</code>
         class (or <code>net.sf.saxon.event.SaxonOutputKeys</code> for Saxon extensions): for details of the
         values that are accepted, see the JavaDoc documentation or the JAXP specification.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Here is an example that produces wrapped output:</p>
      
      
      <div class="codeblock" style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px"><pre><code>
     XQueryExpression exp = xquery.compileQuery("//book");
     DynamicQueryContext dynamicContext = new DynamicQueryContext();
     dynamicContext.setContextNode(xquery.buildDocument(new StreamSource(new File("books.xml")));
     SequenceIterator books = exp.iterator(dynamicContext);
     DocumentInfo resultDoc = QueryResult.wrap(books, config);
     Properties props = new Properties();
     props.setProperty(OutputKeys.METHOD, "xml");
     props.setProperty(OutputKeys.INDENT, "yes");
     QueryResult.serialize(resultDoc, new StreamResult(System.out), props);
</code></pre></div>
      
      
      <p>This example produces output without wrapping:</p> 
      
      
      <div class="codeblock" style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px"><pre><code>
     XQueryExpression exp = xquery.compileQuery("//book");
     DynamicQueryContext dynamicContext = new DynamicQueryContext();
     dynamicContext.setContextNode(xquery.buildDocument(new StreamSource(new File("books.xml")));
     SequenceIterator books = exp.iterator(dynamicContext);
     Properties props = new Properties();
     props.setProperty(OutputKeys.METHOD, "xml");
     props.setProperty(OutputKeys.INDENT, "no");
     int nr = 1;
     while (true) {
         NodeInfo book = books.next();
         if (book==null) break;
         System.out.println("===== BOOK " + nr + " =====");
         QueryResult.serialize(book, new StreamResult(System.out), props);
     }     
</code></pre></div>
      
      <p>If the results do not need to be processed by the application, the same effect can be 
         achieved more efficiently using the code shown below:
      </p>
      
      
      <div class="codeblock" style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px"><pre><code>
     XQueryExpression exp = xquery.compileQuery("//book");
     DynamicQueryContext dynamicContext = new DynamicQueryContext();
     dynamicContext.setContextNode(xquery.buildDocument(new StreamSource(new File("books.xml")));
     SequenceIterator books = exp.iterator(dynamicContext);
     Properties props = new Properties();
     props.setProperty(OutputKeys.METHOD, "xml");
     props.setProperty(OutputKeys.INDENT, "no");
     exp.run(dynamicContext, new StreamResult(System.out), props);           
</code></pre></div>
