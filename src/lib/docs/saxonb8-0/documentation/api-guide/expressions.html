      <h1>Using XPath Expressions</h1>
      
      
      
      <p>Saxon provides an API for executing XPath expressions. The API is loosely modelled
         on the proposed DOM Level 3 API for XPath. For full documentation, see the Javadoc description of package
         <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath</code>. A sample application using this API is available: it is called <code>XPathExample.java</code>,
         and can be found in the <code>samples/java</code> directory. To run this application, see the instructions
         in <a class="bodylink" href="javascript:topage('samples', 'shakespeare')">Shakespeare XPath Sample Application</a>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>This API is based on the class <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath.XPathEvaluator</code>. This class provides a few
         simple configuration interfaces to set the source document, the static context, and the context node,
         plus a number of methods for evaluating XPath expressions.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Here is a simple example of the use of this class:</p>
      
      
      <div class="codeblock" style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px"><pre><code>// Create an XPathEvaluator and set the source document

InputSource is = new InputSource(new File(filename).toURL().toString());
SAXSource ss = new SAXSource(is);
XPathEvaluator xpe = new XPathEvaluator(ss);

// Declare a variable for use in XPath expressions

StandaloneContext sc = (StandaloneContext)xpe.getStaticContext();
Variable wordVar = sc.declareVariable("word", "");

// Compile the XPath expressions used by the application

XPathExpression findLine =
    xpe.createExpression("//LINE[contains(., $word)]");
XPathExpression findLocation =
    xpe.createExpression("concat(ancestor::ACT/TITLE, ' ', ancestor::SCENE/TITLE)");
XPathExpression findSpeaker =
    xpe.createExpression("string(ancestor::SPEECH/SPEAKER[1])");

// Create a reader for reading input from the console

BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

// Loop until the user enters "." to end the application

while (true) {

    // Prompt for input
    System.out.println("\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Enter a word to search for, or '.' to quit:\n");

    // Read the input
    String word = in.readLine().trim();
    if (word.equals(".")) {
        break;
    }
    if (!word.equals("")) {

        // Set the value of the XPath variable
        wordVar.setValue(word);

        // Find the lines containing the requested word
        List matchedLines = findLine.evaluate();

        // Process these lines
        boolean found = false;
        for (Iterator iter = matchedLines.iterator(); iter.hasNext();) {

            // Note that we have found at least one line
            found = true;

            // Get the next matching line
            NodeInfo line = (NodeInfo)iter.next();

            // Find where it appears in the play
            findLocation.setContextNode(line);
            System.out.println("\n" + findLocation.evaluateSingle());

            // Find out who the speaker of this line is
            findSpeaker.setContextNode(line);

            // Output the name of the speaker and the content of the line
            System.out.println(findSpeaker.evaluateSingle() + ":  " + line.getStringValue());
        }

        // If no lines were found, say so
        if (!found) {
            System.err.println("No lines were found containing the word '" + word + "'");
        }
    }
}

// Finish when the user enters "."
System.out.println("Finished.");

      <p>The <code>XPathEvaluator</code> must be initialized with a source document, which can be supplied
         as a JAXP <code>Source</code> object. Any kind of <code>Source</code> object recognized by Saxon is
         allowed (including, for example, a JDOM source). This can be supplied either in the constructor for the
         <code>XPathEvaluator</code>, or through the <code>setSource</code> method. The <code>setSource</code> 
         method returns a <code>net.sf.saxon.om.DocumentInfo</code> object representing the root of the
         tree for the document: this is useful if you want to use some of the more advanced features of the 
         Saxon API, but you can ignore it if you don't need it.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>There are two methods for direct evaluation of XPath expressions,
         <code>evaluate()</code> which returns a List containing the result of the expression (which in general is a sequence),
         and <code>evaluateSingle()</code> which returns the first item in the result (this is appropriate where it is known
         that the result will be single-valued). The results are returned as <code>NodeInfo</code> objects in the case of nodes,
         or as objects of the most appropriate Java class in the case of atomic values: for example, Boolean, Double,
         or String in the case of the traditional XPath 1.0 data types.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>XPath itself provides no sorting capability. You can therefore specify a sort order in which you want
         the results of an expression returned. This is done by nominating another expression, via the <code>setSortKey</code>
         method: this second expression is applied to each item in the result sequence, and its value determines
         the position of that item in the sorted result order.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You can call methods directly on the <code>NodeInfo</code> object to get information about a node: for
         example <code>getDisplayName()</code> gets the name of the node in a form suitable for display, and
         <code>getStringValue()</code> gets the string value of the node, as defined in the XPath data model. You
         can also use the node as the context node for evaluation of subsequent expressions, by calling the
         method <code>setContextNode</code> on the <code>XPathEvaluator</code> object.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It is also possible to prepare an XPath expression for subsequent execution, using the 
         <code>createExpression()</code> method
         on the <code>XPathEvaluator</code> class. This is worthwhile where the same expression is to be executed repeatedly.
         The compiled expression is represented by an instance of the class
         <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath.XPathExpression</code>,
         and it can be executed repeatedly, with different context nodes. The compiled expression can
         only be used with documents that were constructed using the same NamePool (which will be the
         case if the default NamePool is used throughout)
      </p>
      
      
      <p>A compiled expression can reference XPath variables; the values of these variables must be supplied
         before the expression is evaluated, and can be different each time it is evaluated. To do this you will
         need access to the <code>StandaloneContext</code> object used by the <code>XPathEvaluator</code>: you
         can get this by calling <code>getStaticContext</code> and casting the result to a <code>StandaloneContext</code>.
         Before compiling
         an expression that uses variables, the variables it uses must be declared using the <code>declareVariable()</code> method
         on the <code>StandaloneContext</code> class. This method returns a <code>Variable</code> object, whose
         <code>setValue()</code> method can be used to set a value for the variable before the expression is
         evaluated.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The <code>StandaloneContext</code> object is also needed if the XPath expression uses namespaces (which
         it will need to, if the source document itself uses namespaces). Before compiling or evaluating an
         XPath expression that uses namespace prefixes, the namespace must be declared. You can do this explicitly
         using the <code>declareNamespace()</code> method on the <code>StandaloneContext</code> object. 
         Alternatively, you can use the <code>setNamespaces()</code> method, which declares all the namespaces
         that are in-scope for a given node in the source document.
         Certain namespaces are predeclared with their conventional prefixes: the XSLT namespace (xsl),
         the XML namespace (xml), the XML Schema namespace (xs), and the Saxon namespace (saxon). 
      </p>
      
      
      <p>All the core XPath functions are available, with the exception of the <code>document</code> function.
         The XSLT-specific functions, such as <code>key</code> and <code>generate-id</code>, are not available.
         You can call Java extension functions by binding a namespace to the Java class (for example, 
         <code>java:java.lang.Double</code>). You can also call Saxon and EXSLT extension functions using their
         normal namespace - with the exception of a small number of Saxon extension functions, such as
         <code>saxon:evaluate</code> and <code>saxon:serialize</code>, which work only in an XSLT context.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <p>The design principle of this API is to minimize the number of Saxon classes that need to be used.
         Apart from the <code>NodeInfo</code> interface, which is needed when manipulating Saxon trees, only the four classes
         XPathProcessor, XPathExpression, StandaloneContext, and XPathException are needed. 
         For convenience, these classes are all in the <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath</code> package.
