      <h1>Conformance with other specifications</h1>
      
      
      <p>Saxon is dependant on the user-selected XML parser to ensure conformance with the XML 1.0 or 1.1
         Recommendation and the XML Namespaces Recommendation. The syntax for names appearing in XPath expressions
         follows the XML 1.0 rules.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Saxon implements the <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt;</code> processing instruction as described in the 
         W3C Recommendation <i>Associating StyleSheets with XML Documents</i>.
         The <b>href</b> pseudo-attribute must be a URI identifying an XML document containing a stylesheet,
         or a URI with a fragment identifier identifying an embedded stylesheet. The fragment must be the value
         of an ID attribute declared as such in the DTD.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Saxon works with any SAX2-conformant XML parser that is configured to enable namespace 
         processing. There is one limitation: on the startElement() call from the XMLReader to the
         ContentHandler, the QName (that is, the third argument) must be present. According to the SAX2
         specification, namespace-aware parsers are not obliged to supply this argument. However, all
         commonly-used parsers appear to do so.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Saxon should work with any DOM-conformant XML parser, however, Saxon's DOM interface is tested
         only with Crimson and Xerces, and DOM implementations are known to vary widely.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>When a DOM or JDOM tree is supplied as the transformation input, Saxon does not combine adjacent
         text nodes into a single node. Adjacent text nodes can occur as the result of user modifications to the
         tree, or as a result of the presence of CDATA sections or entity references, depending on the options
         in force when the tree was constructed.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>When a DOM or JDOM tree is supplied as the transformation input, Saxon does not take the <code>xml:space</code>
         attribute into consideration when deciding whether or not to strip whitespace text nodes.
      </p>
