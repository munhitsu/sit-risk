      <h1>Writing extension functions</h1>
      
      
      <p>An extension function is invoked using a name such as <code>prefix:localname()</code>.
         The prefix must
         be the prefix associated with a namespace declaration that is in scope. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Extension functions must be implemented in Java.</p>
      
      
      <p><b>The command line option -TJ is useful for debugging the loading of Java
            extensions. It gives detailed information about the methods that are examined for
            a possible match.</b></p>
      
      
      
      <p>These functions do not need to be declared. The URI for the
         namespace identifies the Java class where the external function will be found.
         The namespace URI should be "java:" followed by the fully-qualified class name
         (for example <code>xmlns:date="java:java.util.Date"</code>). 
         The class must be on the classpath. 
      </p>
      
      
      
      <p><i>For compatibility with other products and previous Saxon releases, Saxon (in XSLT only) supports
            certain other formats of URI. The URI may be a string containing a "/", 
            in which the fully-qualified class name appears after the final "/".
            (for example <code>xmlns:date="http://www.jclark.com/xt/java/java.util.Date"</code>). The part of
            the URI before the final "/" is immaterial. 
            The format <code>xmlns:date="java.util.Date"</code> is also supported.</i></p>
      
      
      <p>The Saxon namespace URI "http://saxon.sf.net/" is recognised as a special case, and causes the
         function to be loaded from the class <code>net.sf.saxon.functions.Extensions</code>. 
         This class name can be specified explicitly if you prefer.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>There are three cases to consider: static methods, constructors, and instance-level methods. In
         addition, a public field in a class is treated as if it were a zero-argument method, so public static
         fields can be accessed in the same way as public static methods, and public instance-level fields
         in the same way as instance-level methods.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Static methods</b> can be called directly.
         The localname of the function must match the name of a public static method in this class. The names
         match if they contain the same characters, excluding hyphens and forcing any character that follows
         a hyphen to upper-case. For example the XPath function call <code>to-string()</code> matches the Java method
         <code>toString()</code>; but the function call can also be written as <code>toString()</code> if you prefer.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If there are several methods in the class that match the localname, and that have the correct number
         of arguments, then the system attempts
         to find the one that is the best fit to the types of the supplied arguments: for example if the 
         call is <code>f(1,2)</code> then a method with two <code>int</code> arguments will be preferred
         to one with two <code>String</code>
         arguments. The rules for deciding between methods are quite complex. Essentially, for each candidate method,
         Saxon calculates the "distance" between the types of the supplied arguments and the Java class of the 
         corresponding method in the method's
         signature, using a set of tables given below. For example, the distance between the XPath data type "boolean"
         and the Java class "boolean" is very small, while the distance between an XPath string and a Java boolean
         is much larger. If there is one candidate method where the distances of all arguments are less-than-or-equal-to
         the distances computed for other candidate methods, and the distance of at least one argument is smaller,
         then that method is chosen. 
         If there are several methods with the same name and the correct number of arguments, but none is
         preferable to the others under these rules, an error is reported: the message indicates that there is
         more than one method that matches the function call.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>For example (in XSLT):</p>
      
      
      <div class="codeblock" style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px"><pre><code>&lt;xsl:value-of select="math:sqrt($arg)"
   xmlns:math="java:java.lang.Math"/&gt;
</code></pre></div>
      
      
      <p>This will invoke the static method <code>java.lang.Math#sqrt()</code>, applying it to the value of the variable
         <code>$arg</code>, and copying the value of the square root of <code>$arg</code> to the result tree.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Similarly (in XQuery):</p>
      
      
      <div class="codeblock" style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px"><pre><code>&lt;a xmlns:double="java:java.lang.Double"/&gt; {double:MAX_VALUE()} &lt;a&gt;
</code></pre></div>
      
      
      <p>This will output the value of the static field <code>java.lang.Double#MAX_VALUE</code>. (In practice, it
         is better to declare the namespace in the query prolog, because it will then not be copied to the result tree.)
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Java constructors</b> are called by using the function named <code>new()</code>. 
         If there are several constructors, then again
         the system tries to find the one that is the best fit, according to the types of the supplied arguments. The result
         of calling <code>new()</code> is an XPath value whose type is denoted by a QName whose local name
         is the actual Java class (for example <code>java.sql.Connection</code> or <code>java.util.List</code>)
         and whose namespace
         URI is <code>http://saxon.sf.net/java-type</code> (conventional prefix <code>class</code>). Any '$'
         characters in the class name are replaced by '-' characters in the QName.
         The only things that can be done with a wrapped Java Object
         are to assign it to a variable, to pass it to an extension function, and to convert it to a string, number,
         or boolean, using the rules given below.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Instance-level methods</b> (that is, non-static methods)
         are called by supplying an extra first argument of type Java Object which is the
         object on which the method is to be invoked. A Java Object is usually created by calling an extension
         function (e.g. a constructor) that returns an object; it may also be passed to the style sheet as the
         value of a global parameter. Matching of method names is done as for static methods.
         If there are several methods in the class that match the localname, the system again tries to
         find the one that is the best fit, according to the types of the supplied arguments.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>For example, the following XSLT stylesheet prints the date and time. (In XSLT 2.0, of course,
         this no longer requires extension functions, but the example is still valid.)
      </p>
      
      
      <div class="codeblock" style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px"><pre><code>
&lt;xsl:stylesheet
  version="1.0"
  xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
  xmlns:date="java:java.util.Date"&gt;

&lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;
  &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;xsl:if test="function-available('date:to-string') and function-available('date:new')"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="date:to-string(date:new())"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre></div>
      
      
      <p>The equivalent in XQuery is:</p>
      
      
      <div class="codeblock" style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px"><pre><code>
declare namespace date="java:java.util.Date";
&lt;p&gt;{date:to-string(date:new())}&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre></div>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>A Java method called as an extension function may have an extra first argument of
         class <code>net.sf.saxon.expr.XPathContext</code>.
         This argument is not
         supplied by the calling XPath or XQuery code, but by Saxon itself. 
         The <code>XPathContext</code> object provides methods to access many
         internal Saxon resources, the most useful being <code>getContextItem()</code> which returns the context item
         from the dynamic context. The XPathContext object is not available with constructors.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If any exceptions are thrown by the method, or if a matching method cannot be found,
         processing of the stylesheet will be abandoned. If the tracing option has been set (-T) on the
         command line, a full stack trace will be output. The exception will be wrapped in a
         <code>TransformerException</code> and passed to any user-specified <code>ErrorListener</code> object, 
         so the <code>ErrorListener</code> can also produce extra diagnostics.
      </p>
