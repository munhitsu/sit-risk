Name/Description,Choice,Rationale,Remarks,,,,,,,
Stage 1: Converting textual data into xml,perl,Language optimized for textual data processing,,,,,,,,
Stage 2: Filtering data based on the expert advice,xslt,Language optimized for xml->xml conversion,"After expert’s conclusions were written up, an xml file was created ",,,,,,,
Stage 3: Data gap-filling,"java, xslt",Part of data processing was convenient in xslt. Interpolation using secondary splines. Existing java numerical libraries were used ,,,,,,,,
Stage 4: Knowledge extraction from data,java,"Large number of libraries, transferability","Neural network library selected: joone
Network architecure selection library chosen: jgap",,,,,,,
Stage 5: Infering,java,"Infering means transoforming the xml patients’ data into output data (conlusions), by using an engine and knowledge. Stage 5 shares the code with Stage 4. ",,,,,,,,
Transformation coordination tool,ant,"Native xslt, java support (compiling, method developing)",,,,,,,,
Network library ,Joone,"Open, well documented. Capacity for distributed computing. Easy implementation of custom input/output layers",Library has been modified by expanding with xml input data support,,,,,,,
Data imaging,"xslt, svg",svg is an xml expression of graphical objects. Transformation of xml data in svg by using xslt is natural. ,,,,,,,,
Transformation,mainly xslt 2.0,Well defined standard. Capable of converting xml into any variation of xml. ,Objective was to create some appendixes and figures as xml->pdf conversion,,,,,,,
Xslt transformation,saxon,Closest implementation of xslt 2.0 (working draft). The author collaborates on defining the standard,,,,,,,,
Data format,xml,Univarsal format. Large number of libraries and editors interpreting and checking the syntax compatibility. ,,,,,,,,
